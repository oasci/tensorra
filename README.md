<h4 align="center">Lightweight, performant <i>n</i>-dimensional arrays</h4>

Tensorra provides a simplistic framework for working with *n*-dimensional data in [mojo][mojo] with [MAX][MAX].
Our framework is a building block for more complex projects, allowing developers to extend and build upon it while keeping the core project lean and focused.
